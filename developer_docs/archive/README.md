# developer_docs Archive

This is the single centralized archive location for documentation history.

Rules:
- Archived docs are historical reference only.
- Active docs stay in their original functional locations.
- Preserve original folder structure under this archive root whenever possible.

Examples:
- `developer_docs/archive/2026.01.28 NOTES/...`
- `developer_docs/archive/refactor_plan/...`
- `developer_docs/archive/LOGGING_FIXES/...`
- `developer_docs/archive/copilot-conversations/...`

Canonical current workflow intent:
- `developer_docs/2026.02.05 NOTES/UNIFIED_WORKFLOW_INTENT.md`
