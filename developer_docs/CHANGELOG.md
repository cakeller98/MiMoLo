## 2026-02-07

### Added
- Added canonical workflow-intent consolidation at `developer_docs/2026.02.05 NOTES/UNIFIED_WORKFLOW_INTENT.md`.

- Added centralized archive index at `developer_docs/archive/README.md`.

### Changed
- Updated canonical notes index and matrix to include unified workflow-intent and full docs triage references.

- Centralized archived docs into `developer_docs/archive/` and removed scattered local archive folders.
- Added `Reference-History` banner notes to all `MERGE`-classified documents.
- Updated 2026.01.28 reference README and triage paths to point to centralized archive locations.
