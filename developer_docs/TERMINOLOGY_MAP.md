# MiMoLo Terminology Map (Deprecated → Current)

This document maps legacy naming to the current vocabulary. It preserves history
while keeping the docs consistent going forward.

## Core Roles
- **Agent** → **Agent**
- **Reporter/Exporter** → **Reporter**
- **Dashboard** → **Control** (future rename; not implemented yet)
- **Orchestrator** → **Operations** (future rename; not implemented yet)

## Notes
- **Code identifiers** remain unchanged for now (e.g., `field_agent` in config).
- **Docs/UI** should use the current terms above, and mention deprecated terms
  once when introducing a concept.
