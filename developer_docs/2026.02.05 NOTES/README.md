# 2026.02.05 NOTES

This folder is the canonical ground-truth notes location as of 2026-02-05.

Scope:
- Reflect current codebase behavior first.
- Keep planned-but-unimplemented items explicitly marked as `Planned`.
- Treat all earlier notes folders (for example `2026.01.28 NOTES`) as reference-only history.

Canonical execution/backlog tracker:
- `GROUND_TRUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md`

Strategic roadmap (separate from active backlog):
- `developer_docs/8_Future_Roadmap_and_Summary.md`

Primary docs in this folder:
- `GROUND_TRUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md`
- `NOTES_TRIAGE_2026-02-05.md`
- `UNIFIED_WORKFLOW_INTENT.md`
- `DEVELOPER_DOCS_TRIAGE_2026-02-06.md`
