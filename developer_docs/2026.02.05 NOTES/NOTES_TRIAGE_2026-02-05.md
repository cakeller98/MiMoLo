# Notes Triage (KEEP / ARCHIVE / MERGE)

Date: 2026-02-07
Policy:
- `KEEP`: still useful as direct reference and not superseded.
- `MERGE`: content preserved in canonical 2026.02.05 ground-truth notes.
- `ARCHIVE`: historical log/duplicate/superseded detail retained for traceability.

## Triage decisions
1. `developer_docs/2026.01.28 NOTES/1-29-2026_context.md`
- Decision: KEEP
- Reason: clean snapshot of architecture direction and terminology change context.

2. `developer_docs/2026.01.28 NOTES/2026-01-29_status_combined.md`
- Decision: MERGE
- Reason: canonicalized status/checklist source for late-January planning.
- Merged into:
  - `developer_docs/2026.02.05 NOTES/GROUND_TRUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md`

3. `developer_docs/2026.01.28 NOTES/2026-01-29_status.md`
- Decision: ARCHIVE
- Reason: superseded by combined status and now by 2026.02.05 ground truth.

4. `developer_docs/2026.01.28 NOTES/2026-01-29_status_v2.md`
- Decision: ARCHIVE
- Reason: superseded by combined status and now by 2026.02.05 ground truth.

5. `developer_docs/2026.01.28 NOTES/another run.md`
- Decision: ARCHIVE
- Reason: raw run transcript; high-detail historical artifact.

6. `developer_docs/2026.01.28 NOTES/current_test_run.md`
- Decision: ARCHIVE
- Reason: raw run transcript; high-detail historical artifact.
