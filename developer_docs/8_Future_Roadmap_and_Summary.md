## Future Roadmap and Summary

MiMoLo v0.3 defines a mature foundation for the asynchronous Agent ecosystem—  
a modular, language-agnostic framework that monitors creative and system activity with microscopic impact.  
Its architecture has proven resilient, extensible, and cooperative: agents observe independently, the orchestrator governs predictably, and the control presents insight without interference.  
From this base, future work will focus on refinement, autonomy, and secure scalability.

### Roadmap Highlights
- **Schema Registration:** Introduce a formal `mimolo-agent-schema.json` for versioned validation, protocol evolution, and cross-language tool generation.
	- almost completed: [[AGENT_PROTOCOL_SPEC]]
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Implement per-agent CPU and memory namespaces to guarantee isolation and enforce hard resource ceilings.  
- **Adaptive Intelligence:** Enable Agents to self-tune sampling and reporting intervals using historical performance metrics.  
- **Distributed Collectors:** Expand orchestrator capabilities to manage remote or networked agents securely across multiple hosts.  
- **Control Evolution:** Add live data replay, timecard generation, and real-time template editing with immediate preview.  
- **Telemetry Analytics:** Aggregate multi-session statistics for long-term productivity and reliability insights.

**Closing Principle:**  
MiMoLo exists to **observe without intrusion**—a framework where countless autonomous monitors quietly collaborate to produce clarity without cost.  
Its goal is simple yet absolute: *always be aware, never be in the way.*
